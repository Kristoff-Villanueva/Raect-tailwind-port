                Since 2014, I have been building websites using website builders like Wix, Squarespace, Shopify and Weebly. Eventually, I needed more features so I self-studied programming and joined a coding bootcamp by KodeGo by 917 Ventures, Inc.

                Although I'm not a Computer Science graduate, my knowledge in Electrical Engineering, especially logics and math, paved the way to a deeper understanding about computer systems and how these machines work. My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, responsive design principles and website optimization. So far, I have JavaScript, Python, CSS, HTML, Git, GitHub, SQL, and Bootstrap under my belt. I've started learning React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Angular.
